# Introduction

This page explain how to customize the appearance/behavior of the AFTViewer command.

## setting.json

You can change some setting values by creating `setting.json` file in the configuration directory.
If AFTViewer find `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable, the configuration directory is
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aftviewer`.
Otherwise the directory is `~/.config/aftviewer`.

Sample: [sample.json](https://github.com/MeF0504/aftviewer/blob/main/samples/setting_sample.json)  
Default values: [default.json](https://github.com/MeF0504/aftviewer/blob/main/aftviewer/core/default.json)

# parameters

This json file should be consist of one dictionary.
The keys could be specified in this dictionary are "config", and "colors".  
The details are following.
"""
config = """## "config"
**type: dictionary**  
This dictionary define default values of configuration parameters.
Possible keys in this dictionary are "defaults" or file-type names.
The "defaults" set the values used by multiple file types if the parameter is not set on each file type.
Keys of file types set the values only used in this file type.
In the case that the key is file type, values of both parameters in "defaults" and file-type-specific parameters are able to set.
The parameters that can be set are as follows.
"""

colors = """## "colors"
**type: dictionary**  
This dictionary defines color settings.
Each color type takes two values; the first one is the foreground color and
the second one is the background color.
Available values are following:  
'k' (Black), 'r' (Red), 'g' (Green), 'y' (Yellow),
'b' (Blue), 'c' (Cyan), 'm' (Magenta), 'w' (White),
0-255 (terminal 256 colors if supported),

Keys of this dictionary is same as "config" dictionary: "defaults" or file-type names.
Parametes and values in each key also works as the same.
