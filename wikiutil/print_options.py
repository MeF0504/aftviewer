# Introduction

This page explain how to customize the AFTViewer command.

## setting.json

You can change some default values by creating `setting.json` file.
If AFTViewer find `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable, the path is
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aftviewer/setting.json`.
Otherwise the path is
`~/.config/aftviewer/setting.json`.

Sample: [sample.json](https://github.com/MeF0504/aftviewer/blob/main/samples/setting_sample.json)  
Default values: [default.json](https://github.com/MeF0504/aftviewer/blob/main/aftviewer/core/default.json)

# parameters

This json file should contain one dictionary.
The keys could ne specified in this dictionary are "additional_types", "defaults", and names of file type.  
The details are following.
""")

print("""## "additional_types"
**type: dictionary**  
A dictionary to define the additional supporting types and their extension of files.
A module name of an additional type is the key name of the dictionary, and the value is the string of extensions with separated by space.
e.g. "png_sample": "png jpeg jpg".  
Note that you need to put the additional module in the `lib/viewers` directory.
See the [[Extension page|Extension]] for detail.

print("""## "defaults"
**type: dictionary**  
This key define default configuration values.
Values in this directory are used if the item is not specified in each file type.
The items that can be set are as follows.""")
